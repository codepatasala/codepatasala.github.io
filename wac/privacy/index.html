    <h1>Policy for WhatsApp Connect</h1>

    <p>Last Updated: 14/11/2023</p>

    <h2>
      Hey there! Welcome to the privacy policy for WhatsApp Connect. <br />
      We want you to know how we handle your information when you use our app.
    </h2>

    <h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>

    <p>
      Good news â€“ we don't collect any personal information from you. No need to
      worry about sharing your name, email, or anything else that's personal.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Stuff - Log Data</h3>

    <p>
      Sometimes, if there's an issue with the app, we might collect some
      technical data called Log Data. <br />
      This includes things like your device's IP address, device name, the
      version of your operating system, how the app is set up, and the time and
      date you use the app. <br />It's nothing personal, just technical details.
      This is provided by android by default. We do not add anything on top of
      it.
    </p>

    <h3>No Cookies Here</h3>

    <p>
      We don't use cookies in our app. So, you won't see any of those around
      here.
    </p>
